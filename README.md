# Real Estate Market Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

## Overview
This project presents an end-to-end **Real Estate Market Analysis Dashboard** developed using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard analyzes property listings across multiple cities to uncover insights related to **pricing efficiency, agent and office performance, ownership concentration, and neighborhood-level factors**.

The goal is to understand **pricing behavior, operational performance, portfolio concentration, and location-based value drivers** using descriptive analytics.

## Dataset Overview
The analysis is based on a structured real estate listings dataset containing:

- **~10,000 property listings**
- **300+ real estate agents**
- **50 offices**
- **500+ property owners**
- **Multiple cities**, including **Austin, Dallas, and Houston**
- Attributes covering:
  - Listed price and estimated market value  
  - Property features and condition  
  - Agent experience and activity  
  - Office performance  
  - Ownership portfolios  
  - Neighborhood indicators (crime rate, income, school rating, quality score)

The dataset represents **property listings**, not completed sales.

## Key Insights

### Pricing & Market Behavior
- Average listing values range between **$0.55M – $2.2M** depending on city and neighborhood
- Certain cities consistently show **overpricing or underpricing gaps** relative to estimated market value
- Pricing efficiency varies significantly by **office and agent experience level**

---

### Agent Performance Insights
- **Mid-level agents (3–6 years experience)** handle **fewer properties** but achieve the **highest average listing value (~$0.50M per property)**
- Veteran agents manage **higher volume**, but average listing value plateaus
- This reveals a **quality-over-quantity efficiency sweet spot** at mid experience levels

---

### Office-wise Performance
- Top offices handle **300–400+ properties**, generating **$150M–$200M+** in listing value
- Strong positive correlation between **portfolio size and total listing value**
- Some offices achieve **higher value per property**, indicating better pricing efficiency

---

### Owner & Portfolio Distribution
- Portfolio ownership is **highly concentrated**
- One top owner (e.g., *Peter*) controls **~2,300+ properties** with **~$1.15B portfolio value**
- Majority of owners hold **11–20 properties**, while a small group dominates total market value
- This suggests presence of **institutional or investment-heavy owners**, not just individual buyers

---

### Neighborhood Analysis
- High-income neighborhoods show **average listing prices ~20–30% higher**
- Crime rate impact is present but **not linear** — medium-crime areas sometimes outperform low-crime areas
- Neighborhood quality score shows a **stronger alignment with price than crime alone**
- Top neighborhoods consistently cross **$1.7M–$2.2M average listing price**

---

## Dashboard Structure
The dashboard consists of **15+ interactive pages**, including:
- Property Overview & Pricing Analysis
- Agent Performance (multiple levels)
- Office-wise Performance
- Owners & Portfolio Distribution
- Neighborhood Analysis

Each page is designed to answer a specific business question and supports filtering by city and listing type.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Real estate value is driven by **location, pricing discipline, and portfolio strategy**, not just volume.
- **Efficiency metrics** (value per property) provide deeper insights than raw counts.
- Performance and ownership follow **power-law distributions**, with concentration among top contributors.
- Clear storytelling with numbers significantly improves dashboard interpretability.
