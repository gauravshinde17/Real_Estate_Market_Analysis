# Real Estate Market Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

## Overview
This project presents an end-to-end **Real Estate Market Analysis Dashboard** developed using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard analyzes property listings across multiple cities to uncover insights related to **pricing efficiency, agent and office performance, ownership concentration, and neighborhood-level factors**.

The goal is to understand **pricing behavior, operational performance, portfolio concentration, and location-based value drivers** using descriptive analytics.

## Key Insights

### Pricing & Market Behavior
- Average listing values range between **$0.55M – $2.2M** depending on city and neighborhood
- Certain cities consistently show **overpricing or underpricing gaps** relative to estimated market value
- Pricing efficiency varies significantly by **office and agent experience level**

---

### Agent Performance Insights
- **Mid-level agents (3–6 years experience)** handle **fewer properties** but achieve the **highest average listing value (~$0.50M per property)**
- Veteran agents manage **higher volume**, but average listing value plateaus
- This reveals a **quality-over-quantity efficiency sweet spot** at mid experience levels

---

### Office-wise Performance
- Top offices handle **300–400+ properties**, generating **$150M–$200M+** in listing value
- Strong positive correlation between **portfolio size and total listing value**
- Some offices achieve **higher value per property**, indicating better pricing efficiency

---

### Owner & Portfolio Distribution
- Portfolio ownership is **highly concentrated**
- One top owner (e.g., *Peter*) controls **~2,300+ properties** with **~$1.15B portfolio value**
- Majority of owners hold **11–20 properties**, while a small group dominates total market value
- This suggests presence of **institutional or investment-heavy owners**

---

### Neighborhood Analysis
- High-income neighborhoods show **average listing prices ~20–30% higher**
- Crime rate impact is present but **not linear**
- Neighborhood quality score aligns more closely with pricing than crime alone
- Top neighborhoods consistently exceed **$1.7M–$2.2M average listing price**

---

## Key Takeaways
- Real estate value is driven by **location, pricing discipline, and portfolio strategy**, not just volume.
- **Efficiency metrics** (value per property) provide deeper insights than raw counts.
- Performance and ownership follow **power-law distributions**, with concentration among top contributors.
- Clear storytelling with numbers significantly improves dashboard interpretability.
